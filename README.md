# Hi, I'm Isaac Oyediran

I'm a Biomedical Informatics M.S. student at NYU with a passion for solving real-world problems using AI, automation, and data-driven tools. From clinical NLP and bioinformatics pipelines to mobile apps and decision support systems, I love building solutions that bridge tech and impact.

### Projects & Work Highlights

#### AI & Biomedical Research
- **[LLM Classification of Lung Cancer Radiology Reports](https://github.com/isaacoyediran/llm-lung-cancer-thesis)**  
  Evaluated LLaMA and RoBERTa models for classifying radiology impressions (stable, regression, progression). Designed few-shot prompt strategies and built a full model evaluation pipeline.

- **[VCO Alert System Evaluation (NYU Langone)](https://github.com/isaacoyediran/vco-alert-evaluation)**  
  Evaluated a Clinical Decision Support (CDS) system for Virtual Constant Observation (VCO) at NYU Langone. Analyzed 183,000+ alert records and provider feedback using quantitative stats and NLP methods. Delivered insights on alert burden, provider behavior, and system performance; proposed UI, logic, and implementation improvements.

- **[ED Pneumonia Risk Stratification CDS Design](https://github.com/isaacoyediran/pneumonia-cds-design)**  
  Created a clinical decision support tool to flag high-risk pneumonia patients during ED triage. Developed scoring logic, pseudocode, workflow mapping, alert design, and evaluation framework.

- **[Enzyme Periodicity Analysis](https://github.com/isaacoyediran/enzyme-length-analysis)**  
  Used spectral analysis and mixture modeling to uncover periodic constraints in 18,000+ eukaryotic enzymes. Applied SAD, Fourier transforms, and Gamma+Normal fitting.

- **[Skin Cancer Classification (HAM10000 CNN)](https://github.com/isaacoyediran/ham10000-cnn-classifier)**  
  Built a CNN classifier for dermatoscopic skin cancer images using the HAM10000 dataset. Applied EDA and benchmarked performance with confusion matrices and accuracy metrics.

#### Bioinformatics & Health Data
- **[COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Analysis (VAERS)](https://github.com/isaacoyediran/covid19-vaers-analysis)**  
  Analyzed 17,000+ COVID-19 vaccine adverse event reports in North Carolina. Created severity scores based on symptoms and conducted correlation analysis using R.

- **[Wearable Glucose Monitoring & Food Log Database](https://github.com/isaacoyediran/healthcare-db-management)**  
  Designed a normalized PostgreSQL database integrating Dexcom G6 glucose data with food and activity logs. Built ER diagrams, SQL queries, and data extraction functions.

- **[RNA-Seq Differential Expression Workflow](https://github.com/isaacoyediran/rnaseq-final-project)**  
  Processed GEO data for an RNA-seq study using DESeq2. Performed read alignment, normalization, and differential expression analysis in R.

#### Apps
- **[CheckMate+](https://github.com/isaacoyediran/checkmate-app)**  
  A minimalist iOS app that helps users log and verify task completion (e.g., locking doors, turning off appliances). Built to reduce second-guessing and streamline daily routines.
